## About
AIBase gives you a codebase for any deep learning project. Don't reinvent the wheel!

## Table of Contents

- [Codebases Available](#codebases-available)

## Codebases Available
Here are the codebases available:
- Pytorch (Vanilla)
- Lightning
> ℹ️
> Each codebase follows the _card_ pattern in which you pass to a `train.py` file a config file (e.g. `config_test.py`) containing your model, your dataset and everything required to train a model.


## Useful Commands
To launch a _MLflow_ server, in the `code/output/experimentManager/MLflow` folder, execute the following script:
```
❯ ./launch_server.sh
```
